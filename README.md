### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Leo

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently optimizing the performance of databricks data pipelines with lots of hierarchical data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about GraphFrames/GraphX. Any DevOps and Terraform hints are also welcome!
- :compass: I'm currently living in the United Kingdom :guard: :teapot:
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Big Data, Spark/Databricks, Machine Learning or any Data Engineering topic :tea: I'm really glad to help! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: A Linkedin message is more than welcome! 

- :alembic:	Iâ€™m also creating nice public repos for knowledge sharing in data-related topics, but in a minimalist / straightforward way (I hate tutorials where you need to configure lots of things... Simple > Complex > Complicated) 

P.S > :sob: The repos may take a while since I'm doing them in my spare time, but feel free to send suggestions :nerd_face: (or coffee :coffee:). If you'd like to contribute give me a shout!
